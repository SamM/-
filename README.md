This is my last chance to write something as a message to anyone before I stop sending any messages or speaking with any words, or writing any letters or words on a note as a message.
I am allowing myself pictures atleast for* communication, hopefully I become good at establishing a non verbal language with those around me from now on. Hopefully this change won't affect my hobbies too much, if it does I will adapt and choose new hobbies.
ðŸ™Š emojis are fine if they don't spell something with letters like ðŸ†‘ðŸ…¾ðŸ…±ðŸ…±ðŸ…°
Sorry for any inconvienence this causes, hopefully I either make the effort to make it up to you immediately, or you are patient enough for the full conversation after I stop this endeavour.
It is 6AM now on the 27th May 2023, the exercise in self-restraint and discipline described above (not sending/speaking/writing verbal language as a message to anyone) started then and will finish at 6AM 27th May 2024**.
This adventure would probably be easier with assistance along the way. I'll be all ears :D
